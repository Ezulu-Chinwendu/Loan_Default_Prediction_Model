## MACHINE LEARNING LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION MODEL
When a loan is issued, there is a chance that the borrower will either repay it according to the agreed terms or default. Every lending organization aims to ensure that borrowers repay their loans on time, but this is not always the reality. In cases of loan default, lenders incur losses as the loans are written off, and the resulting shortfall is recorded as an expense. Provisions for potential defaults diminish the total loan portfolio of lending institutions, which negatively impacts interest earnings on assets, ultimately representing a significant cost to these organizations. Consequently, lenders aspire to extend loans only to those who are likely to repay, which requires accurately identifying reliable borrowers. In this project, I will develop a Machine Learning model designed to predict loan defaults at the application stage with high accuracy. This model can inform data-driven decisions regarding the approval or rejection of loan applications.
### Dataset
I will be using the LendingClub dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club. LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company based in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to facilitate loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is currently the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
